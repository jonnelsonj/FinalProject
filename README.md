# FinalProject
This program will be an assignment planner for a student. 
This program will begin by displaying a calendar. The user will select a date MM/DD/YYYY, and then another window will open showing them their assignments for the selected dates. From there, they will have the option to add, edit, delete, or mark complete. Should they choose to add or edit, the program will ask for: Title, Subject, Due Date, Description, a boolean to determine if it is complete, and a boolean to determine if it is overdue. The program will then save all of this information to a text file so that if the program is closed, it can easily be reopened and none of the information stored will be lost. 

I would like to include a few additional features: 
1. If the due date is past due, I would like the date on the calendar to turn red. If it is due soon, yellow. If there is still plenty of time, green. 
2. I would like to include something to incorporate leap year into the calendar. 
3. If possible I would like the calendar to automatically open to the current month and highlight the current date somehow.
4. The calendar should properly display the days of the week, not just the dates.
